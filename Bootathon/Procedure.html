                        <p class="text-left mb-0">A well mixed sample is filtered through a standard glass fiber filter, and the filtrate is evaporated to dryness in a weighed dish and dried to constant weight at 179- 181°C. The increase in dish weight represents the total dissolved
                            solids. A well mixed sample is filtered through a weighed standard glass fiber filter and the residue retained on the filter is dried to a<br>constant weight at 103-105°C. The increase n weight of the filter represents the
                            total suspended solids. If the suspended material clogs the filter and prolongs filtration, the difference between the total solids and total dissolved solids may provide an estimate of the total suspended solids.<br><br></p>

                                    oven at 180*C for one hour.<br>2.&nbsp;Now weigh the empty evaporating dish in analytical balance. Let’s denote the weight measured as W1 = ________ g.<br>3. Using pipette transfer 75mL of unfiltered sample in the porcelain
                                    dish.<br>4. Switch on the oven and allowed to reach 105°C. Check and regulate oven and furnace temperatures frequently to maintain the desired temperature range.<br>5. Place it in the hot air oven and care should be
                                    taken to prevent splattering of sample during evaporation or boiling.<br>6. Cool the container in a desiccators. Desiccators are designed to provide an environment of standard dryness. This is maintained by the desiccant
                                    found inside.<br>7. Don't leave the lid off for prolonged periods or the desiccant will soon be exhausted. Keep desiccators cover greased with the appropriate type of lubricant in order to seal the desiccators and prevent
                                    moisture from entering the desiccators as the test glassware cools.<br>8. We should weigh the dish as soon as it has cooled to avoid absorption of moisture<br>due to its hygroscopic nature. Samples need to be measured
                                    accurately, weighed<br>carefully, and dried and cooled completely.<br>9. Note the weight with residue as W2 = _______g.<br><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TESTING OF SAMPLE FOR TOTAL SUSPENDED SOLIDS</strong><br>1.&nbsp;Place

                                    water.<br>4. Pour selected volume into filtration apparatus.<br>5. Draw sample through filter into filter flask.<br>6. Rinse graduated cylinder into filtration apparatus with three successive 10 mL portions of distilled
                                    water, allowing complete drainage between each rinsing.<br>7. Continue suction for three minutes after filtration of final rinse is completed.<br>8. Dry filter in an oven at 103-105°C for at least 1 hour.<br>9. Cool
                                    filter in desiccator to room temperature.<br>10.
